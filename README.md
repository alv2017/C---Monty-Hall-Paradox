# C++ - Monty Hall Paradox

*When you have a question that can't be solved by people arguing, you can sometimes
 use a computer program to run a simulation and see what happens. Isn't it better 
 than just arguing forever?*
 
 *Brian Overland. C++ Without Fear.*
 
 This is my first project written in C++, and as you might have guessed it is inspired by Brian Overland book "C++ Without Fear" and a famous Monty Hall Problem. 
 
 The project code simulates a popular game show hosted by the harismatic Monty Hall. Monty's name will always be associated with the logical problem called Monty Hall Paradox:
 
 *Suppose you're on a game show, and you're given the choice of three doors: Behind one door is a car; behind the others, goats. You pick a door, say No. 1, and the host, who knows what's behind the doors, opens another door, say No. 3, which has a goat. He then says to you, "Do you want to pick door No. 2?" Is it to your advantage to switch your choice?*
 
 First time I read about the Monty Hall problem when I was a student, and to be honest, at that time I didn't understand the reasoning behind the solution, so when I found a chapter "Object-Oriented Monty Hall" in Brian's book, I got totally hooked up and determined to figure the things out. :-)
 
 The project contains two parts. The first part simulates the game itself. The code is contained in the folder called 'game', and it closely replicates the code from the book. The second part of the project is a statistical experiment, where we estimate the probability of winning after switching the choice, and compute a confidence interval for the estimated probability. The code is contained in the folder called 'simulator', and it is written by me! :-)
